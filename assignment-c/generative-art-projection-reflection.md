## Why I like the chosen Generative Art


######His work with connected lines have been my fascination when it comes to his work, I’ve chosen this art because I like the blend of colors clashing into each other, it creates some sort of an artistic landscape through lines which can also create different forms and shapes through the use of lines. Sol Lewitt experiments this minimalist approach with simple black and white colors. I have decided to use the colors close to what Sol’s using through the use of connecting lines.
